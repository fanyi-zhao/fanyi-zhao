Hi there, I'm @fanyi-zhao and I love programming with Java ☕️, Rust, Python 🐍, and OCaml 🐫. 
Currently, I'm interested in expanding my knowledge in compilers, optimization, and formal verification. 
At the moment, I'm learning Rust 🚀, LLVM 🛠, and [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) to improve my skills. 
If you have an interesting project, I would love to collaborate with you. You can reach me at euclideanrn@163.com.
